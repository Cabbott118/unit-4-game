# unit-4-game

When starting the game, you will be prompted to open the console if you wish to see the hidden assignments to the crystals.

You start the game with a base score of zero and a random number value to match your score to.

While having less than the randomly generated score, you will still be allowed to click on any of the four crystals to increase your score.

Upon reaching the random number, but not exceeding it, you will be alerted a "Win" message and the game will reset and increment your "Wins."

If your score at any point reaches a number higher than your random number, you will be alerted the "Loss" message and the game will reset and increment your "Losses."

The console outputs each crystal's number assignment for your session as well as keeps track of the incremented score, and wins and losses.
